## Hello there! I'm Facu 👋
### I'm a Civil Engineering student 📚
Beyond my love for structural calculations, I enjoy coding and delving into the latest tech trends 💻

When I'm not immersed in the engineering world, you'll find me playing the drums 🥁 or enjoying a cup of coffee ☕

I'm here to blend my engineering enthusiasm with the creativity of programming, so let's talk about exciting and challenging projects! ✨🚀
